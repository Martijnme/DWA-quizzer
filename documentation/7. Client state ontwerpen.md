# Structuring Redux
This product uses React Redux to manage the state of the application. All states are saved in the store. Working with Redux means the application contains different reducers that give access to this store. You can interact with them by using actions. Here you can see a list of these reducers and actions.

# Player

* combiner (This is not really a reducer, but a function that combines all reducers.)

* questionReducer


## Actions
